## How It's Made:
HTML, CSS, JavascriptNode, Express & MongoDB

I built this project once I was more comfortable with working on the back end and incorporated some calculations for funsies!

## Lessons Learned:
Rendering the calculations how I wanted to was a bit tricky, but once I figured out how to target the values I needed for the calculations, the rest was cake.



## Installation/Usage
1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `node server.js`
4. Navigate to `localhost:6060`
